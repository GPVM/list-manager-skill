## List Manager
Create and manage lists of any kind.

## Description
*List Manager* is a simple utility for filing lists of things you don't want to forget.
Whether these are titles of books to read, the specs of your new bike, or random thoughts for a new programming project; you can ask Mycroft to create a list them!

## Examples
 - "What lists do I have?"
 - "What's on my important list"
 - "Add a new list called travel plans"
 - "Add coffee to my shopping list"
 - "Remove my finals list"
 - "Remove return books to the library from my today list"
